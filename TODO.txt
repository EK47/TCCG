IDEAS:

The Death Chase element - On reaching 0 HP, you are not dead, but you are chased
by death. You die once he reaches you. The only way to avoid your fate is to somehow
get your HP back up to max.


ISSUES / FEATURES:


Work on the line interpolation for the lightning
spell, and the explosion effect for the fireball.

Make a wait feature that goes until all health is
restored, or until a creature is seen in FOV.

Fix the magic number FOV problem :p

Add doors in the random generation system.

Adjust autoheal to be more consistent

Implement more creatures, potions, and maybe use
the random potion / scroll name feature.

Work on REXPaint art.
