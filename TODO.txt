The Death Chase element - On reaching 0 HP, you are not dead, but you are chased
by death. You die once he reaches you. The only way to avoid your fate is to somehow
get your HP back up to max.



Fix the autoheal of other creatures

Work on REXPaint art.

Work on the line interpolation for the lightning
spell, and the explosion effect for the fireball.

Implement more creatures, potions, and maybe use
the random potion / scroll name feature.

Make a wait feature that goes until all health is
restored, or until a creature is seen in FOV.

Fix the magic number FOV problem :p
